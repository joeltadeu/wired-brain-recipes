Thai Coffee
----------------------------------------

Ingredients:

2 large cups hot, strongly brewed coffee or strong instant coffee (if using leftover coffee, briefly reheat)
4 to 6 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
Ice cubes
1/4 cup evaporated milk or fresh heavy cream

Preparation:

Pour hot coffee into a glass jug or other container for mixing and pouring.
Add sweetened condensed milk to taste and stir well until dissolved. Add a few ice cubes and refrigerate for 1 or more hours.
To serve, place a few ice cubes in the bottom of each glass and pour the coffee over. Top each drink with a few tablespoons of the evaporated milk or heavy cream.
Taste test the coffeeâ€”you want it to taste strong and sweet. Add more sweetened condensed milk if you prefer it sweeter, or more evaporated milk/heavy cream for a richer taste or if it's too strong. (Note that this iced coffee is meant to be rather sweet.)
This iced coffee is excellent as is, or serve with a shot of Cointreau, Bailey's Irish cream, Kahlua, or your favorite liqueur.
